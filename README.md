> Official technical/whitepaper document for 0xcert protocol.

This repository stores the source code of the initial 0xcert Whitepaper. Due to changes done over time, the content in this repository ceased to be relevant. For the sake of transparency, all the final relevant versions of the 0xcert Whitepaper that were presented to the public are available below.

* [whitepaper-0.1](whitepaper-0.1.pdf)
* [whitepaper-0.2](whitepaper-0.2.pdf)
* [whitepaper-0.3](whitepaper-0.3.pdf)
* [whitepaper-0.4](whitepaper-0.4.pdf)
* [whitepaper-0.5](whitepaper-0.5.pdf)
* [whitepaper-0.6](whitepaper-0.6.pdf)

With the end of 2019, we will cease updating the 0xcert Whitepaper and will only keep it in this GitHub repository to enable insight into its content history. Starting with 2020, the sole relevant reference of 0xcert will be our website [https://0xcert.org](https://0xcert.org) and the official 0xcert social media profiles.

## Development
